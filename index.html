        <h3><a href=..2.4 Movie Ranking Project/> List of my most used sites</a></h3>
        <p>This project was my first project. It was really fun. I learnt to create ordered and unordered lists. I even learnt how to make the orderd lists start on any number I'd like. In this example, I started counting on number 5.</p>

        <h3><a href=3.4 Birthday Invite Project"> Invite to my birthday party</a></h3>
        <p> This project was even more fun because I learnt to embed images and video. I even learnt how to make my sites more accessible to visually impaired folks by adding the alt text for screen readers</p>
